          (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there
          is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have
          several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take
          place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week,
          many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
          including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls). The
          parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes;
          most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
          earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
          earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
          modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
          events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
          celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
          (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as
          the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American
          krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The
          most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons,
          decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys.
          Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
          While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
          Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts
          and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
          upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the
          Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
          Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi
          Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
          the Courts" between Rex and Comus

          Mardi Gras Indians have been practicing their traditions in New
          Orleans at least since the mid-19th century, possibly before. The
          history of the Mardi Gras Indians is shrouded in mystery and folklore.
          <h4>Congo Square:</h4>
          In 1740, New Orleans' Congo Square was a cultural center for African
          music and dance. New Orleans was more liberal than many Southern
          cities, and on Sundays African slaves gathered to sing folk songs,
          play traditional music, and dance. The lively parties were recounted
          by a Northern observer as being "indescribable... Never will you see
          gayer countenances, demonstrations of more forgetfulness of the past
          and the future, and more entire abandonment to the joyous existence to
          the present moment. The idea of letting loose and embracing
          traditional African music and dance is a backbone of the Mardi Gras
          Indians practice
          <h4>Native American and African American encounters:</h4>
          As a major southern trade port, New Orleans became a cultural melting
          pot. During the late 1740s and 1750s, many enslaved Africans fled to
          the bayous of Louisiana where they encountered Native Americans. Years
          later, after the Civil War, hundreds of freed slaves joined the U.S.
          Ninth Cavalry Regiment, also known as Buffalo Soldiers. The Buffalo
          Soldiers fought, killed, forced, and aided the mass removal and
          relocation of the Plains Indians on the Western Frontier. After
          returning to New Orleans, many ex-soldiers joined popular Wild West
          shows, most notably Buffalo Bill's Wild West. The show wintered in New
          Orleans from 1884 to 1885 and was hailed by the Daily Picayune as "the
          people's choice". There was at least one black cowboy in the show, and
          there were numerous black cowhands. On Mardi Gras in 1885, 50 to 60
          Plains Indians marched in native dress on the streets of New Orleans.
          Later that year, it is believed the first Mardi Gras Indian gang was
          formed; the tribe was named "The Creole Wild West" and was most likely
          composed of members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. However, the
          "Indian gangs" might predate their appearance in the City. A source
          from 1849 refers to black performers on Congo Square fully covered in
          "the plumes of the peacock.” The origins of the Mardi Gras Indians
          have also been traced to mock-war performances by warriors from the
          Kingdom of Kongo.

          <h2>Suits:</h2>
          <hr />
          <a href="./img3.jpg">
            <img src="./img3.jpg" alt="Revelers on St. Charles Avenue, 2007" />
          </a>
          Mardi Gras Indian suits cost thousands of dollars in materials alone
          and can weigh upwards of one hundred pounds. A suit usually takes
          between six and nine months to plan and complete. Each Indian designs
          and creates his own suit; elaborate bead patches depict meaningful and
          symbolic scenes. Beads, feathers, and sequins are integral parts of a
          Mardi Gras Indian suit. Uptown New Orleans tribes tend to have more
          sculptural and abstract African-inspired suits; downtown tribes have
          more pictorial suits with heavy Native American influences. <br />
          The suits are revealed on Super Sunday and rival professional costume
          designers. Even though men dominate the different tribes, women can
          become Mardi Gras Indian "Queens" who make their own costumes and
          masks. The suits incorporate volume, giving the clothing a sculptural
          sensibility. Darryl Montana, son of the Big Chief of the Yellow
          Pocahontas "Hunters" tribe, states that the suits each year cost
          around $5,000 in materials that can include up to 300 yards of down
          feather trimming. The suits can take up to a year to complete as each
          artist needs to order materials, design the layout, sew and bead. The
          beadwork is entirely done by hand and feature a combination of color
          and texture. Some of the suits are displayed in museums throughout the
          country.

          <h2>Parade formation and protocol:</h2>

          </a>
          The Mardi Gras Indians play various traditional roles. Many blocks
          ahead of the Indians are plain clothed informants keeping an eye out
          for any danger. The procession begins with "spyboys," dressed in light
          "running suits" that allow them the freedom to move quickly in case of
          emergency. Next comes the "first flag," an ornately dressed Indian
          carrying a token tribe flag. Closest to the "Big Chief" is the
          "Wildman" who usually carries a symbolic weapon. Finally, there is the
          "Big Chief." The "Big Chief" decides where to go and which tribes to
          meet (or ignore). The entire group is followed by percussionists and
          revelers. <br />
          During the march, the Indians dance and sing traditional songs
          particular to their gang. They use hodgepodge languages loosely based
          on different African dialects. The "Big Chief" decides where the group
          will parade; the parade route is different each time. When two tribes
          come across each other, they either pass by or meet for a symbolic
          fight. Each tribe lines up and the "Big Chiefs" taunt each other about
          their suits and their tribes. The drum beats of the two tribes
          intertwine, and the face off is complete. Both tribes continue on
          their way.
          <h4>Violence:</h4>
          In the early days of the Indians, Mardi Gras was a day of both
          reveling and bloodshed. "Masking" and parading was a time to settle
          grudges. This part of Mardi Gras Indian history is immortalized in
          James Sugar Boy Crawford's song, "Jock O Mo" (better known and often
          covered as "Iko Iko"), based on their taunting chants. However, in the
          late 1960s, Allison Montana, "Chief of Chiefs", fought to end violence
          between the Mardi Gras Indian Tribes. He said, "I was going to make
          them stop fighting with the gun and the knife and start fighting with
          the needle and thread." Today, the Mardi Gras Indians are not plagued
          by violence; instead, they base their fights over the "prettiness" of
          their suits.

          The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast
          of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional
          balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event. <br />

          Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling
          before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival clubs, called krewes, take
          on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers.
          Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!" <br />

          The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi
          Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex
          Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate
          costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all
          ages. <br />

          New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and
          cuisine, is an exciting place to be at any time of the year. We invite
          everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime.
          Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see
          firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"
